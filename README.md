## Project Overview

![image](img/Stolzwichtel.gif)

Stolzwichtel aims to educate and entertain by emphasizing the significance of using the correct colors of the German flag. It critiques the notion of misplaced national pride, advocating instead for pride based on personal achievements and contributions.

Nationalists, Nazis, and individuals from the right-wing political spectrum refer to June as "Pride Month" (Stolzmonat) to portray themselves as a minority and garner more attention. This is in stark contrast to Pride Month, which is celebrated by the LGBTQ+ community. By appropriating the concept of a pride month, these groups aim to draw parallels to the struggles of historically marginalized communities, despite promoting exclusionary and often discriminatory ideologies. This appropriation is seen as an attempt to undermine the significance of LGBTQ+ Pride Month, which celebrates diversity, acceptance, and equality.
